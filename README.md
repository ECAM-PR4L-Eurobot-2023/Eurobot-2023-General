## Scoring points

Ways to score points :

* Cakes (max 10/cake) :
  * must be at least partially on a plate, max 3/plate
  * 1 point each cake layer (max 3)
  * 4 additional points if 3 layers in legendary order
  * 3 additional points if cherry on a cake (max 1/cake)
* Basket (max 60 if 10 internal + 40 external cherries are used) :
  * 5 points if it exists
  * 1 additional point per cherry in basket
  * 5 points if basket count is correct and not null
* Placement (max 15) :
  * 15 points if robot ends in its own dropping area
* Disguise (max 5) :
  * 5 points if robot is disguised at the end
* Bonus :
  * 20 points max if points estimation is correct (for example, you say you'll make 35 points but you only make 30, you will win 20-(35-30) (so 15) bonus points)
